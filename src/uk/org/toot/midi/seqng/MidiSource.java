/**
 * A MidiSource is a composite MidiEvent iterator. This is the contract required
 * by a Player/Renderer to be able to use arbitrary track based representations
 * of music. Such representations may be edited whilst being played. In general
 * the representation need not be known a priori, it could even be generated in
 * real-time. An implementation of this class can be properly decoupled from the
 * underlying representation. The implementation of this class should know about
 * its underlying representation, that representation should not know about this
 * implementation. Clients of this class need not know about any such
 * representation or any specific implementation of this class.
 * 
 * There are 2 edge cases in iteration.
 * 
 * Assume we have notes X then Y and X has already been consumed such that
 * peek() and next() would both return Y. At some point peek() will return Y and
 * its tick will indicate that it is ready to play so we would proceed to obtain
 * it with next(). If inbetween peek() and next() the model is altered such that
 * note Z is inserted between X and Y there are two eventualities. next() will
 * now return Z. It may be too late to play in which case it should be ignored
 * but it may be that it should play in which case it will be played and peek()
 * and next() would subsequently obtain note Y which next() was originally
 * expecting. So in this case an apparent race condition with note insertion
 * near the current iterator position is handled properly.
 * 
 * Again, assume we have notes X then Y then Z and X has already been consumed such that
 * peek() and next() would both return Y. At some point peek() will return Y and
 * its tick will indicate that it is ready to play so we would proceed to obtain
 * it with next(). If inbetween peek() and next() the model is altered such that
 * Y is deleted next() will return Z. It may be that Z is too early to be played
 * in which case next() has consumed it too early and Z would not subsequently
 * be played at the appropriate time. In this case the race condition with note deletion
 * near the current iterator position is not handled properly and notes may be lost.
